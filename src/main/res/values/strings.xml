    <string name="text_info"> SeniorGPS is checking personÂ´s movement on the recorded path. If the person is not on path, the app will send a text message to selected phone number with its position in periodic intervals until returned on track. \n
        <br>\n You can set the width of the path in settings. \n</br>
        <br>\n Each path starts and ends with a width 10x bigger than set in settings. Keep that in mind should you go to a big building(hospital, shopping malls). \n</br>
        <br>\n If the phone checks ten times in a row off the path, Call for help button will activate. \n</br>
